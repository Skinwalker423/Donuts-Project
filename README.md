Landing page for Museum of Donuts

Fully responsive page that eliminates some elements as it scales down in size. 
Bootstrap was used to assist with the navbar and the responsive design.
I added in Javascript to change the background color of the navbar as the user scrolls down the page for better visibility. If the user scrolls back to the top of the page, then the color reverts to the default color.
